## About

Hi, my name is Hana Acciaioli and I'm a full-stack software engineer. I love learning how the web world works and am constantly discovering new ways to improve my work.

On my free time I like to play outside and I also enjoy getting crafty. Please feel free to contact me to talk about coding, climbing, snowboarding, cooking, or art, because I love all of it.

Thanks for stopping by!
